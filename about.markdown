## My Background
I was born and raised in the small desert town of Apple Valley, California. It is an expansively barren & dystopic desert landscape situated in California's southern desert. It's always a source of inspiration in my life.

I first began my journey into design while studying Architecture at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. During my final year, I took assignments with part time work at the University Admissions Office where I maintained existing websites by fixing bugs and adding new features. I gained a considerable amount of experience that I needed to step into the industry.

Once obtaining my Bachelor's of Architecture, I flew one way to New York and eventually began work as Creative Director for a small tech firm. I was responsible for the front end web development of various projects, such as web applications, mobile apps, static websites and various print media.

With the variety of work and my attitude towards learning, I quickly grew into a dependable, valuable multidisciplinary designer that can work both solo and within professional teams.

I now work as a Senior Information Architect and a Lead UX Designer at a top full service digital agency.

## Design Approach
When it comes to design, I value white space, typography, and function. I focus on design and technology as broader approaches to experience, product performance and consumer perception. I firmly believe that experience is about the ideas & process, not resultant artifacts.
