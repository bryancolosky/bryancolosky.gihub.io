## About Me
As an experienced information architect, UX designer and creative director, I have worked with large Fortune 500 enterprises, small startups, and nonprofits. I have created award-winning digital, social, and memorable experiences for some of the worldâ€™s most recognizable brands including Peterbilt, Leviton, HAVI, CSA Group, and Baldor Foods.

My professional experience includes analyzing business and marketing requirements, designing user flows, sitemaps, wireframes, and documenting functional specifications.

I have lead a cross-functional team of UX designers and digital specialists at a top full service digital agency focusing on human centered design.

## Design Approach
When it comes to design, I value white space, typography, and function. I focus on design and technology as broader approaches to experience, product performance and consumer perception. I firmly believe that experience is about the ideas & process, not resultant artifacts.

## Personal Background
I was born and raised in the small desert town of Apple Valley, California. It is an expansively barren & dystopic desert landscape situated in California's southern desert. It's always a source of inspiration in my life.

On the weekends, I enjoy cooking and exploring cultures through food, architecture, and sport. In 2014 I met my wonderful and beautiful wife, Melda. We love to travel to new places, taste craft beers, and look at the stars at night.
