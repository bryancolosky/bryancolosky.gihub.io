## About Me
As an experienced information architect, UX designer and creative director, I have worked with large Fortune 500 enterprises, small startups, and nonprofits. I have created award-winning digital, social, and memorable experiences for some of the world’s most recognizable brands including Peterbilt, Leviton, HAVI, CSA Group, and Baldor Foods.

My professional experience includes analyzing business and marketing requirements, designing user flows, sitemaps, wireframes, and documenting functional specifications.

I have lead a cross-functional team of UX designers and digital specialists
at a top full service digital agency focusing on human centered design.

## Design Approach
When it comes to design, I value white space, typography, and function. I focus on design and technology as broader approaches to experience, product performance and consumer perception. I firmly believe that experience is about the ideas & process, not resultant artifacts.

## Personal background
I was born and raised in the small desert town of Apple Valley, California. It is an expansively barren & dystopic desert landscape situated in California's southern desert. It's always a source of inspiration in my life.

On the weekends, I enjoy cooking and exploring cultures through food, architecture, and sport. In 2014 I met my wonderful and beautiful wife, Melda. We love to travel to new places, taste craft beers, and look at the stars at night.
