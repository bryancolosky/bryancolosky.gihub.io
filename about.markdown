I first began my journey into design while studying Architecture at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. During my final year, I took assignments with part time work at the University Admissions Office where I maintained existing websites by fixing bugs and adding new features. I gained a considerable amount of experience that I needed to step into the industry.

Once obtaining my Bachelor's of Architecture, I flew one way to New York and eventually began work as Creative Director for a small software startup. I was responsible for the front end web development of various projects, such as web applications, mobile apps, static websites and various print media.

With the variety of work and my attitude towards learning, I quickly grew into a dependable, valuable multidisciplinary designer that can work both solo and within professional teams.

I now work as a Senior Information Architect for Blue Fountain Media.
