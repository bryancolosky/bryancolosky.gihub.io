overview: Maptycs is a risk Analytics system that helps risk and insurance professionals
  maximize the value of information. Maptycs transforms and consolidates your risk
  and insurance data making it not only easier access, but also easier to analyze
  and spot trends.

challenge: Risk managers, CFO's, and insurance brokers needed a new web application
  to help consolidate data from assets, claims, and policies that had been spread
  over e-mail, hard-drives, and paper sources. Risk managers especially needed to
  compare their data against 3rd party data events such as FEMA flood zones, California
  EQ Zones, and historical event data. Live event and weather data is also especially
  important for clients with international portfolios. Maptycs presented three main
  challenges â€” development of a visualization tool to consolidate users' data, sync
  the tool with API's with useful 3rd party data, and to explore what could be possible
  in future iterations.
design-approach: Because users primarily focused on proximity & spatial relationships
  rather than aggregate statistics on a day to day basis. Special colorized maps were
  designed so users could view their plotted assets in different contexts. Map options
  emphasized transport, administration zones, bodies of water, and terrain topography.
  Clusters, heat maps, measuring tools, and filtering tools in which users could draw
  complex shapes or regions to select assets within were all made available to the
  user. An enormous amount of supplemental open source data was uploaded into the
  application. Users could turn off & on nuclear plants, fire stations, police departments,
  hospitals, airports, and civic institutions.

- research: Collaboration sessions and interviews with top risk managers & insurance
    brokers helped define industry wide technological deficiencies & business requirements.
    These sessions helped to understand the goals of a risk manager, their role in
    the insurance market, and insights into the problems they faced. The research
    identified three areas in which technology could assist users on daily, monthly,
    and yearly basis. Technology within the industry is very dated, and we identified
    the users' comfort and familiarity with computing & cloud technologies. While
    familiar with web browsers & existing mobile applications, the audience was generally
    unaware of cloud based solutions. User's workflows consisted of checking dozens
    of news, government, non-profit, and education websites for information on floods,
    earthquakes, hurricanes, and political data. They were also manually updating
    multiple spreadsheets to keep up-to-date data for their assets. Some of which
    would contain 5,000+ rows with 150+ columns.

- sketching: After completing the research, identifying our user personas, and out-lining
    each user journey, I began the design process with hand sketching or whiteboard
    diagrams for team collaboration. Hand sketching components & data schemes allowed
    for rapid organization of relevant information. With so much client & 3rd party
    data, hand sketching afforded the design to evolve into more human scaled 'chunks'
    of data. Once the data was arranged into domains, we began to focus on user &
    system settings that would give user custom monitoring thresholds. We used sketching
    & collaborative whiteboard sessions to answer potential user questions.

description: The project team decided to produce interactive mock-ups that could also
  provide value later in the development process. The team had identified that typical
  wire-frames & PDF mock-ups were mostly discarded & not updated during the development
  phase. To create a more adaptable artifact that provided development value & could
  change quickly, we created live HTML + CSS mock-ups. These gave the software team
  working templates, as well as provided the entire team with a living document &
  set of components. Design-by-code helped the team manage expectations, and adapt
  to challenges without being tied to an expected visual outcome. By coding early
  in the process, the whole team was able to collaborate on solutions.
