challenge: With 3 regional distribution centers, hourly price updates per customer account, and daily ordering cutoffs times, not only did Baldor Foods need to provide its customers with a robust ordering system, but also coordinate a large amount data and business intelligence across several endpoints.

design-approach: Drawing on insights from user surveys and customer support channels, I set out to create an eCommerce website that artfully showcased Baldorâ€™s products, streamline the buyer journeys, and offer multiple avenues to discover, save, and order products for its customers.
