challenge: With 3 regional distribution centers, hourly price updates per customer
  account, and daily ordering cutoffs times, not only did Baldor Foods need to provide
  its customers with a robust ordering system, but also coordinate a large amount
  data and business intelligence across several endpoints.
design-approach: Drawing on insights from user surveys and customer support channels,
  I set out to create an eCommerce website that artfully showcased Baldor’s products,
  streamline the buyer journeys, and offer multiple avenues to discover, save, and
  order products for its customers.
