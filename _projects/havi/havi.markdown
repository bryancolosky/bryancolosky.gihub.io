challenge: When approached, HAVI’s core service offerings were spread across several
  websites with different branding and identities. Because of the fragmented ecosystem,
  customers of one service line were often unaware of the integrated nature of HAVI’s
  offerings. Combined with a high bounce rate, website visitors were not reaching
  out before leaving the website.
design-approach: The goal was to present a unified, global, integrated company to
  prospective clients and the world. By unifying the full customer experience through
  a single website showcasing the full portfolio of HAVI’s services, HAVI will be
  well-positioned to generate leads, grow the business, and increase visibility with
  prospective employees.
