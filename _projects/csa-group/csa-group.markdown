challenge: As a global organization and a provider of enterprise, mission-critical services to some of the world’s biggest brands, the website needed to provide concise user journeys for several different audiences – prospective leads, members, and employees – all the while still providing a clear and compelling overview of the company's unique history, and industry role. Even further, the website required integration with CSA's e-commerce store, of which various audiences  purchase yearly and versioned compliancy standards documents.
