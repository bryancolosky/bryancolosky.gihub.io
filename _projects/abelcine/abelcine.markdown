details: 
overview: AbelCine is professional camera shop and equipment rental-house focused
  on digital cinema, broadcast, high-speed, VR, and 360Â° video, as well as optics,
  audio, lighting, workflows, and post.
challenge: AbelCine came with the challenge of rebuilding their e-Commerce platform
  from the ground up. Part of its remit was to improve the user experience and include
  a much cleaner UI that matched their brand and achieved more conversions. The current
  code and deployment solution also needed revisiting to be scalable and flexible.
design-approach: Create an intuitive architecture to lay out a structure for eCommerce
  development. Where products were once divided up by brand, we took an audience-centric
  approach, regrouping products into new distinct categories that corresponded to
  AbelCine's audiences and uses.
