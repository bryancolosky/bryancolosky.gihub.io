challenge: AbelCine came with the challenge of rebuilding their e-Commerce platform from the ground up. Part of its remit was to improve the user experience and include a much cleaner UI that matched their brand and achieved more conversions. The current code and deployment solution also needed revisiting to be scalable and flexible.
