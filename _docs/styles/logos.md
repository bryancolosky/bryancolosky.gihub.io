# Logo Lockup
The logo lockup is the primary logo and should be used in most instances.
{% include pattern-block.html url='/patterns/branding/logos' %}

# Mark
In cases where the CareDox brand has already been established we simply use the mark on its own. While the icon can exist without the wordmark, the wordmark should never exist without the mark.
