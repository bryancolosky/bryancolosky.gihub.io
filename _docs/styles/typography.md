title: Typography
info: Typography can help create clear hierarchies, organize information, and guide users through a product or experience. Websites need clear and consistent headings, highly legible body paragraphs, clear labels, and easy-to-use input fields. Our default typefaces are designed for legibility and can adapt to a variety of visual tones.
