# Date Formatting
## Day
Day of the week can (if needed) be shortened to 3 characters (e.g. Friday becomes Fri).

## Month
- Month can (if needed) be shortened to 3 characters (e.g. November becomes Nov).
- If day of the week is included, it should be first in the order, followed by a comma.
- A month should always be accompanied by a year, for clarity.

## Year
- A year should never be abbreviated. Use the full 4 digits.
- The day of the month should be a singular number. Don’t suffix a date with “th”, “st” or “rd” (e.g. use 24, not 24th), as this is problematic for different languages, internationally.
- The day of the month should always be accompanied by a month. The month followed by the number, and separated by a space. The year should now be separated by a comma and a space, to differentiate from the day number before it.

## Times
- Any times, shown inline with a date should follow the time format rules, and be separated from the date with a bullet — [date] • [time].
- If a time is shown inline with a date, you should specify for the day of the month, month, year (and optionally day of the week), for clarity.

## Numerical Dates
- Use 4 digits for the year, so as not to be mistaken for a day or month.
- Be aware that the format/order in which dates (day, month and year) are written, displayed or presented in form fields are very different internationally. This can easily lead to confusion in different countries if the date is presented in a way that they don’t understand.

## Written Dates
- Don’t suffix a date with “th”, “st” or “rd” (e.g. use 24, not 24th), as this is problematic for different languages.
- Dates for today and tomorrow can be expressed as “today” or “tomorrow”. Dates further in the future, or in the past should be expressed more explicitly.
- Use a comma to separate ‘date divisions’, for clarity.
- Days and months can be shortened to three characters to save space, if need be. Default to the full title if there is space.
- Use your discretion as to whether a date should also include a year, to save confusion.

# Time Formats

Use the 24-hour clock when a clinical time is required.

Use the 12-hour clock when a clinical time is not required.

Specify a time zone if the scenario requires it, for clarity.

>Note: The United States is one of the only countries in the world that commonly uses the 12-hour clock.

## Written
The 24-hour notation is more commonly used in written word as it’s clearer as to the exact time of day.

## Conversational
The 12-hour clock is mostly used in spoken word

## Ranges
If displaying a time range, use a hyphen ( - ) to separate the start and end time. Where a 12-hour format is used, the “am” and/or “pm” should be included for both the start and end times, not singularly at the end.


## 24-Hour Clock
The 24-hour clock has no need for either “am” or “pm”.

A colon should be used between the hours and minutes. Any other punctuation can be confused as decimal or monetary.
Always specify minutes, as well as the hour.

## 12-Hour Clock
Where a 12-hour format is used, the time should always be accompanied by a space, followed by “am” or “pm” (lowercase) so it’s clear what times are being communicated.

Specify minutes, as well as the hour.

Exceptions, if space is tight (e.g. mobile):
- Okay to remove space between time and am/pm.
- Okay to remove minutes if time is on the hour.

## Timestamps
Don’t use shorthand for words (e.g. “hr” for hours).

There should be a space between the number and word.

“Now” is calculated as ‘within the past minute’.

The word should be suffixed with an “s” if greater than 1 (e.g. 2 mins).
