# Overview
Tabs organize content across different screens, data sets, and other interactions.

## Usage
Tabs organize and allow navigation between groups of content that are related and at the same level of hierarchy.

#### Tabs in a sets
Each tab should contain content that is distinct from other tabs in a set. For example, tabs can present different sections of news, different genres of music, or different themes of documents.

## Principles
- **Scalable.** As tabs can horizontally scroll, a UI can have as many tabs as needed.
- **Informative.** Tabs organize content into categories to help users easily find different types of information.
- **Peers.** Tabs are displayed next to each other as peers, in categories of equal importance.
