# Overview
Selection controls allow the user to select options.

## Principles
- **Familiar.** Selection controls have been in user interfaces for a long time and should be used as expected.
- **Scannable.** It should be visible at a glance if a selection control has been selected, and selected items should be more visually prominent than unselected items.
