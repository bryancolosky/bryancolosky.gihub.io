# Overview
Data tables display sets of data across rows and columns.

## Usage
Data tables display information in a grid-like format of rows and columns. They organize information in a way thatâ€™s easy to scan, so that users can look for patterns and insights.  

Data tables can contain:  
- Interactive components (such as chips, buttons, or menus)
- Non-interactive elements (such as badges)
- Tools to query and manipulate data

## Principles
- **Organized.** Data tables should organize content in a meaningful way, such as using hierarchy or alphabetization.
- **Interactive.** Data tables should allow user interaction, so that users can customize how data is displayed or interacted with.
- **Intuitive.** Data tables should be easy to use, with a logical structure that makes content easy to understand.
