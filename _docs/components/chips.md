# Overview
Chips are compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action.

## Usage
Chips allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions. Chips should appear dynamically as a group of multiple interactive elements. Unlike buttons, which should be a consistent and familiar call to action, one that a user expects to appear as the same action in the same general area.

## Principles
- **Compact.** Chips are compact components that represent discrete information.
- **Relevant.** Chips should have a clear and helpful relationship to the content or task they represent.
- **Focused.** Chips should make tasks easier to complete, or content easier to sort.
