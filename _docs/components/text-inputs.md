# Overview
Text fields let users enter and edit text.

## Usage
Text fields allow users to enter text into a UI. They typically appear in forms and dialogs.

## Principles
- **Discoverable.** Text fields should stand out and indicate that users can input information.
- **Clear.** Text field states should be clearly differentiated from one another.
- **Efficient.** Text fields should make it easy to understand the requested information and to address any errors.

### Input Types
Text fields can display user input in the following ways:
- **Single line text fields** display only one line of Text
- **Multi-line text fields** grow to accommodate multiple lines of Text
- **Text areas** are fixed-height fields

# Filled Text Fields
## Usage
Filled text fields have more visual emphasis than outlined text fields, making them stand out when surrounded by other content and components.

# Outlined Text Fields
## Usage
Outlined text fields have less visual emphasis than filled text fields. When they appear in places like forms, where many text fields are placed together, their reduced emphasis helps simplify the layout.
