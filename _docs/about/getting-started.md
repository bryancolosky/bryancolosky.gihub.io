# How it Works
Curriculum shares a unified anatomy of documented [components]({{ site.baseurl }}#using-patterns) in order to create a design system.

[Available Patterns]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/about/01-getting-started/index.html#how-it-works)

## The Design Files
The system also contains [design files]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/about/01-getting-started.html#designers) available in ~~both~~ Sketch ~~and Adobe XD~~ Symbols matching the React Components so Designers and Developers are always in sync.

[Download]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/about/01-getting-started/index.html#how-it-works)

## The System Components
Curriculum makes use of a CSS architecture based on a shared anatomy (Color, Typography, Space, Depth, and Motion), and a variety of Components built from this shared anatomy to build responsive digital interfaces at CareDox.
